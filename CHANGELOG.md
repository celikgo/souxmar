# Changelog

All notable changes to souxmar are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The plugin C ABI version is tracked separately and is independent of the project version. ABI v1 is frozen for the entire 1.x series; see [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-c-abi-for-plugins.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Sprint 1 (in progress) — data model + plugin host + C ABI

- `libsouxmar-core` data model in `include/souxmar/core/`:
  - `tag.h` — strong-typed `EntityTag`, `NodeIndex`, `CellIndex`, `VertexIndex`, `EdgeIndex`, `FaceIndex`, `SolidIndex` with std::hash specialisations.
  - `element_type.h` — `ElementType` enum (numerically stable across the on-disk format and C ABI) plus per-type `ElementInfo` (dimension, node count, order, canonical name).
  - `geometry.h` — `Geometry` (PIMPL'd; vertex coordinates, opaque bookkeeping for edges/faces/solids, per-entity tag / name, bounding box, adapter-data slot for native handles).
  - `topology.h` — `Topology` (kind-indexed entity graph for meshes without a CAD model).
  - `mesh.h` — `Mesh` (mixed-element, contiguous flat storage, tag inheritance, element histogram, bounding box).
  - `field.h` — `Field` (scalar/vector/tensor over nodes/cells/faces/Gauss points, optional time series, contiguous storage with VTK-compatible stride).
- **[ABI v1]** Public C ABI headers in `include/souxmar-c/`: `abi.h` (export macros, version constants), `status.h` (numerically-stable error codes), `plugin.h` (entry-point declaration + host-info struct), `registry.h` (capability registration entry), `mesher.h` (first capability vtable), `types.h` (opaque handle declarations). ABI v1 frozen-candidate begins; final freeze at Sprint 7 per `docs/SPRINT_PLAN.md`.
- `libsouxmar-plugin`:
  - `plugin/manifest.h` + `manifest.cpp` — `souxmar-plugin.toml` parser via tomlplusplus, with `ParseError` carrying line context. Validates required fields, capability list, threading model, ABI compatibility.
  - `plugin/discovery.h` + `discovery.cpp` — search-path computation (`SOUXMAR_PLUGIN_PATH`, install prefix, per-OS user prefix, optional CWD), directory walker, manifest validation, binary-existence check, structured `DiscoveryReport` of loaded + rejected.
- Unit tests (GoogleTest) covering the above:
  - `test_tag`, `test_element_type` — strong types + element metadata
  - `test_geometry`, `test_topology` — counts, tag/name roundtrips, bounding-box, move semantics, adapter-data deleter
  - `test_mesh` — node/cell add, mixed elements, histogram, validation errors
  - `test_field` — metadata, components by kind, time-step indexing, error paths
  - `test_manifest` — valid parse, multi-capability, missing-field, threading-model parsing, ABI mismatch, malformed-TOML line reporting
  - `test_discovery` — empty paths, missing path, valid plugin, missing binary, wrong extension, malformed manifest, multi-root aggregation

## How to read this file

- `[Unreleased]` accumulates changes between releases. At release time, the section is renamed to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and a fresh `[Unreleased]` is opened.
- Sections are added only when they have content; empty sections are omitted from a tagged release.
- Each entry is one line, present tense, references the PR or issue when meaningful.
- ABI / pipeline-format / agent-tool changes are called out explicitly with a `**[ABI v1]**` / `**[pipeline-format v1]**` / `**[agent-tool v1]**` prefix so plugin authors and integrators can scan the file for impact.
